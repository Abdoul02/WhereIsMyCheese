The project works fine, here are some minor issues to look out for:

1) The device will need to have location turned on other wise the user will be
taken to settings to switch location on, when he/she returns the device might not
have the current location. a simple solution is to close the application and open it again.

2)When collecting a cheese (after clicking on the cheese) the cheese data is removed from the list of cheese,
however, the information is not updated on the map, unless the latest cheese is collected first.
